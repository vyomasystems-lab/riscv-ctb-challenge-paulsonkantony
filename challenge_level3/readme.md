# Challenge 3 - Capture the Bug
## Approach

Directed Tests were not used at all because we must spend a good amount of time to understand the functionality of Design and identify different verification scenarios to cover functionality.

Since the design itself is not made available, it was more feasible to do random tests rather than to do directed tests with specific test cases.

The YAML files used for the randomly generated tests target specific areas of functionality as listed below:

 1. Arithmetic
 2. Branching
 3. Control and Status Registers
 4. Recursions
 5. Exceptions
